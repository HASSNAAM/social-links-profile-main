- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me improve my understanding of CSS custom properties and variable fonts. Here are some examples of what I learned:

```html
<h1>Jessica Randall</h1>
```
```css
h2 {
   color: var(--Green);
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan to focus on:

Improving my JavaScript skills, particularly with modern frameworks like React.
Enhancing my understanding of responsive design techniques.
Exploring more advanced CSS properties and animations.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) - A comprehensive resource for CSS tutorials and tips.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - A valuable reference for web development documentation.
- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - Helped me write better markdown for documentation.
